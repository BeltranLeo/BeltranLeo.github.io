<!-- **Abstract.** A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. -->

## Set Your Alarm

The first step to waking up early is to set your alarm for an appropriate time. Start by setting your alarm for a few minutes earlier each day until you reach your goal. Be sure to choose an alarm that is pleasant to wake up to and that won't disrupt your sleep.

## Get Into a Routine

Creating a regular morning routine can help you stick to your plan. Start by going to bed at the same time each night and setting your alarm for the same time each morning. You can also add other activities like reading, journaling, or stretching to help you get up and stay motivated.

## Prepare the Night Before

Preparing for the next day the night before can make waking up early easier. Take some time to lay out your clothes, plan your meals, and pack your bag. This will make it easier to get out of bed in the morning and make sure you are ready for the day ahead.

## Conclusion

Waking up early can be a challenge, but it is possible with the right strategies. Set your alarm for an appropriate time, get into a routine, and prepare the night before. With these tricks, you can make waking up early a habit and make the most of your mornings.
