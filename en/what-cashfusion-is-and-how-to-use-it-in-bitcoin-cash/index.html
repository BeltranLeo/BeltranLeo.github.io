It is an implementation of <strong>CoinJoin</strong>, which is a system by which two or more users make a joint transaction, adding their coins into a common pool and then withdrawing them without the other participants knowing which coins correspond to whom.<h2 id=why-is-cashfusion-needed>Why is CashFusion needed?</h2><p>As the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is public, the record of all transactions made by users is recorded. Companies such as <strong>Chainalysis</strong> are dedicated to studying network traffic and trying to combine metadata to identify coins belonging to specific users.<p>With CashFusion, not only does it become exponentially more expensive, but it is virtually impossible to break down a transaction made with this technology to identify the users.<h2 id=advantages>Advantages</h2><ul><li><strong>Improves resistance to censorship.</strong> CashFusion is an effective tool for circumventing controls, regulations and blacklists.<li><strong>It is self-custodial.</strong> CashFusion works in a way that does not require giving access to bitcoins to any third party. The user maintains control of his funds at all times.<li><strong>It has no commission.</strong> In other blockchains, privacy protocols charge users an extra fee to be used. Using CashFusion you only pay the network fee.</ul><h2 id=how-does-cashfusion-work>How does CashFusion work?</h2><p>A traditional Bitcoin Cash transaction can look as follows:<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=highlight><pre class=highlight><code>Inputs | Outputs
-------+--------
2 BCH  | 2.5 BCH
1 BCH  | 0.5 BCH
</code></pre></div></div><p>This is almost certainly a user making a payment for the equivalent of 2.5 BCH, since if it were 0.5, one of the <em>inputs</em> would not be needed. For this reason, we can be almost certain that both <em>input</em> addresses and the <em>output</em> of 0.5 BCH belong to the same individual.<p>To prevent this from happening, confusion can be introduced into the transaction.<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=highlight><pre class=highlight><code>Inputs | Outputs
-------+--------
2 BCH  | 2.5 BCH
1 BCH  | 0.5 BCH
</code></pre></div></div><p>In this way, it is not possible to say exactly what is the origin and destination of the funds. A probabilistic element is introduced that is considered as noise by those who study the blockchain for the purpose of understanding the traffic of currencies.<p>CashFusion applies this principle in collaborative transactions between several participants.<h2 id=simplified-operation>Simplified operation</h2><p>The CashFusion operating protocol is as follows:<ol><li><p>The user connects to a CashFusion server and registers on a public list to announce the size of coins to be mixed. This server is in charge of coordinating the transaction between the different participants.<li><p>The server and the different participants wait until there are enough people waiting to make a merge.<li><p>The merge starts. Each of the participants sends information to the server, but in a way in which it is not possible to know which coins belong to whom, guaranteeing privacy.<li><p>Each user selects new addresses to receive the merged bitcoins. The idea is to use addresses that have not been seen before in the network.</ol><h2 id=how-to-use-cashfusion>How to use CashFusion?</h2><p>The simplest way is to download the desktop or Android version of the <strong>Electron Cash</strong> wallet.<h2 id=external-links>External links</h2><p><strong>Official site:</strong> <a href=https://cashfusion.org/ target=_blank>cashfusion.org</a><p><strong>Link to Electron Cash wallet:</strong> <a href=https://electroncash.org/ target=_blank>electroncash.org</a><p><strong>Technical Specification:</strong> <a href=https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md target=_blank>github.com</a></div></div></div></main><footer><div class=contFooter><div class=div1Footer><h4>Site map</h4><ul><li><a href=/en/>Home</a><li><a href=/en/articles/>Articles</a><li><a href=/en/faqs/>FAQs</a><li><a href=/en/about/>About</a></ul></div><div><h4>Contact and Social Media</h4><ul><li><a href=https://x.com/BitcoinCashAcademy target=_blank>X</a><li><a href=https://t.me/BitcoinCashAcademy target=_blank>Telegram</a><li><a href=mailto:contact@bch.education target=_blank>Email</a></ul></div><div><h4>Languages</h4><ul><li><a href=/es/>Español</a><li><a href=/fr/>Français</a><li><a href=/en/>English</a></ul></div></div><p class=derechoAutor>© Bitcoin Cash Academy 2023</footer>
